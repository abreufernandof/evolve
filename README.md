# Bateria Genome Experiment

*Brorix 84* is a fully water covert planet with two seasons: The floods and the dry. At the dry the temperature falls and the organic matter is less available, the nights last longer. In the floods the organic matter abounds and the hot days are longer than nights. During the flood season the temperature raises about 15% and days are 20% longer than nights, these factors favor the emergence of *scux*, a kind of algae. The dry and cold season is the opposite of that. 

The *scux* is the main energy source for the *Litix*. The *Litix* are small round shape autotrophs that convert organic matter and light into energy. They moves fast and reproduces fast, but only during the days. During the night they slow down their metabolism. Their reproduction is spore-like: When a *Litix* anchieve certain age, they stop and converts it's energy into new *Litix*. *Litix* can live at maximun 25 cycles.

The *Vohix* are the *Litix* main predators, they are large single cell creatures, insensitive to day light conditions, they are slower then the *Litix*, but at night are more dangerous. *Vohix* springs a cub every time it's get enough food. But only one at a time. *Vohix* may live 100 cycles.
